    "body": "<p>This post belongs to a series of posts walking through the rewrite of the site.</p>\n<p>With <a href=\"http://expressjs.com/\">Express</a> and \n<a href=\"http://jsantell.github.io/poet/\">Poet</a> now setup, it was time to migrate the content\nfrom my existing platform into a format that Poet could digest.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-source\">The Source</h3>\n<p>My existing site was built with Drupal 6.  Drupal distributes the data that makes\nup a page across several database tables depending on what kind of content type \nyou have defined and the fields that it contains.  That makes for some pretty\ngnarley SQL queries to get data out.  However, there are plenty of modules that\ncan be installed to make that process easy for you.  I used the <a href=\"https://drupal.org/project/Views_Datasource\">Views Datasource</a>\nmodule.  This module allowed me to create an endpoint that served my content as \nJSON or XML.  </p>\n<p>Initially, I exported as JSON, but because a lot of my content \ncontained embedded HTML, I was loosing data in the encoding / decoding process.\nI found using XML and RSS in particular, I could get all the data that needed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-destination\">The Destination</h3>\n<p>Poet processes content as markdown files with a little metadata at the top. Here\nis an example from the Poet documentation:</p>\n<pre>\n{{{\n  \"title\": \"Hello World!\",\n  \"tags\": [\"blog\", \"fun\"],\n  \"category\": \"javascript\",\n  \"date\": \"7-5-2013\"\n}}}\n\nHere goes the content that belongs to the post...\n</pre>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"the-script\">The Script</h3>\n<p>To bridge the gap I wrote a fairly simple node.js script to hit the RSS feed, \nparse the data, and generate an &quot;.md&quot; file for each article.  I used the \n<a href=\"https://npmjs.org/package/xml2js\">xml2js</a> module to do all the XML parsing.</p>\n<pre>\n// Pull in dependencies\nvar fs = require('fs'),\n             xml2js = require('xml2js');\n\n// Setup parser\nvar parser = new xml2js.Parser();\n\n// To make things easier, I saved the rss feed as an xml file\n// so we read that in here.\nfs.readFile('import.xml', 'utf8', function (err, data) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n\n  // A simple loop that iterates over all the posts and generates\n  // the markdown documents\n  parser.parseString(data, function (err, result) {\n        var posts = result.node.node;\n        posts.forEach(generateMarkdown);\n    });\n});\n\n// A function to generate a markdown document based on a post\nfunction generateMarkdown(post){\n    var fs = require('fs')\n         ,urlSegments = post.Path[0].split('/')\n         ,postId = urlSegments[ urlSegments.length -1 ]\n         ,text = \"\"\n         ,filename = \"../posts/\" + postId +  \".md\";\n\n    // Generate the meta for Poet\n    var meta = JSON.stringify({\n        title : post.Title[0],\n        tags: post.Tags,\n        date : post.Postdate[0],\n        description: post.Teaser[0]\n    });\n\n    text += \"{{\" + meta + \"}}\\n\\n\";\n\n    text += post.Body[0];\n\n    // Delete existing file - This is nice re-running the script\n    fs.unlink(filename);\n\n    // Write new file\n    fs.writeFile(filename, text, function(err) {\n        if(err) {\n            console.log(err);\n        } else {\n            console.log(\"The file was saved!\");\n        }\n    });\n}\n</pre>",

    "body": "<p>This post belongs to a series of posts walking through the rewrite of the site.</p>\n<p>After the decision was made to go with <a href=\"http://expressjs.com/\">Express</a> and \n<a href=\"http://jsantell.github.io/poet/\">Poet</a>, the next step was setting\nup the initial project.</p>\n<p>Express has a great <a href=\"http://expressjs.com/guide.html\">getting started guide</a> so \nI&#39;ll spare the redundancy.  Here is a walk through of my initial Express app.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dependencies\">Dependencies</h3>\n<p>I am pulling in the http and path API&#39;s provided by node.  The modules\nI installed from <a href=\"https://npmjs.org/\">npm</a> include express, express-hbs, html-to-text, and poet.  The \nroutes variable is pulling my url defintions for express.</p>\n<pre>\n    // Express\nvar express = require('express')   \n  , routes = require('./routes')   \n  , http = require('http')    \n  , path = require('path')   \n  , hbs = require('express-hbs') \n  , app = express()         \n  , html2text = require( 'html-to-text') \n  , poet = require('poet')( app ); \n</pre>\n\n<h3 id=\"handlebars-helpers\">Handlebars Helpers</h3>\n<p>I prefer the Handlebars templating engine over Jade.  Express Handlebars integration\nis provided by the express-hbs package on npm.  Here I configure handlebars to \nlook for template files with an &quot;.html&quot; extentsion and to use &quot;layout.html&quot; as \na the base template.</p>\n<pre>\nhbs.express3({\n  extname: \".html\",\n  layout: \"layout\"\n});\n\nhbs.registerHelper('formattedDate', function(date) {\n    return (date.getMonth()+1) + \".\" + date.getDate() + \".\" + date.getFullYear();\n});\n</pre>\n\n<h3 id=\"express-configuration\">Express Configuration</h3>\n<p>This is my Express configuration.  Most of these options are a part of Express.\nThe main things to note here are <code>app.use( poet.middleware() );</code> which\nincludes the poet middleware and using handlebars as the <code>app.engine</code></p>\n<pre>\n// all environments\napp.use(express.bodyParser());\napp.use(express.compress());\napp.use(express.favicon());\napp.use(express.logger('dev'));\napp.use(express.methodOverride());\napp.use(express.cookieParser('your secret here'));\napp.use(express.session());\napp.enable('trust proxy');\napp.use( poet.middleware() );\napp.use(app.router);\napp.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));\napp.set('view options', {layout:true});\napp.set('port', process.env.PORT || 3000);\napp.set('views', __dirname + '/views');\napp.engine('html', hbs.express3({\n  partialsDir: __dirname + '/views',\n  defaultLayout: __dirname + '/views/layout.html'\n}));\napp.set('view engine', 'html');\n</pre>\n\n<h3 id=\"poet-config\">Poet Config</h3>\n<p>Poet routing gives you the option to use its default routes or define custom \nones.  I overroad a lot of the defaults to support my existing post urls.  Note\nthat in the init function I call setupRss.  This generates the RSS feed.</p>\n<pre>\n// poet\npoet.set({\n  posts: './posts/',  // Directory of posts\n  postsPerPage: 10,     // Posts per page in pagination\n  metaFormat: 'json',  // meta formatter for posts\n}).createPostRoute('/blog/:post')\n  .createTagRoute()\n  .init(function ( locals ) {\n    locals.numPages = locals.getPageCount();\n    setupRss(locals);\n  });\n\napp.set('poet', poet);\n</pre>\n\n<h3 id=\"routes\">Routes</h3>\n<p>These are my the routes I set up.  Most of them are blog related includes paging,\ntag navigation, the home page, and the post page.  On top of that, I added an about\npage and a contact page.</p>\n<pre>\n// Routeage\napp.post( '/contact', routes.sendEmail );\napp.get( '/', routes.index );\napp.get( '/about', routes.about );\napp.get( '/contact', routes.contact );\napp.get( '/blog/:yearmonth/:post', routes.legacy );\napp.get( '/page/:page', routes.page );\napp.get( '/tags/:tag', routes.tag );\napp.get( '/tags' , routes.tags );\n</pre>\n\n<h3 id=\"rss\">RSS</h3>\n<p>This code was taken from one of the many examples provided by Poet.  Notice\nhtml-to-text is used here to format that the content for the feed.</p>\n<pre>\nfunction setupRss ( core ) {\n  app.get('/rss', function ( req, res ) {\n    var posts = core.getPosts(0, 1000);\n\n    // Since the preview is automatically generated for the examples,\n    // it contains markup. Strip out the markup with the html-to-text\n    // module. Or you can specify your own specific rss description\n    // per post\n    posts.forEach(function (post) {\n      post.rssDescription = html2text.fromString(post.preview);\n    });\n\n    res.render( 'rss', { posts: posts, layout:false });\n  });\n}\n</pre>\n\n<h3 id=\"server\">Server</h3>\n<p>Now after all the configuration we startup the server.  We use a variable port \nto accomodate hosting, i.e. the host can assign the node process to any port it \nwants.  Lastly, we have a catch all expection handler.  Node can be volital during\ndevelopment.  This prevents the node process from crashing and reports the error in\nyour logs.</p>\n<pre>\n// Start up the server\nhttp.createServer(app).listen(app.get('port'), function(){\n  console.log('Express server listening on port ' + app.get('port'));\n});\n\n// Catch all to prevent exceptions from crashing the app\nprocess.on('uncaughtException', function (exception) {\n  console.error(exception);\n});\n</pre>\n\n<p>There you go. Express is all setup and ready for content.  We will handle that \nin the next post.</p>\n",

    "body": "<p>This post belongs to a series of posts walking through the rewrite of the site.  </p>\n<p>The only thing that I knew to begin with was that I wanted to use node.js.  I \nwanted to build my skill using node, it would simplify keeping the site up to date, \nand perform well.</p>\n<p>That being said, there are a lot of options when dealing with node.  The <a href=\"https://npmjs.org/\">Node \nPackage Manager</a> or &quot;npm&quot; is an open system.  Anyone can submit modules.  This presents\na couple of good problems.  First, there are a lot of options.  Second, determining\nif the module is quality, and is want you need, is on you.</p>\n<h3 id=\"wheat\">Wheat</h3>\n<p>One option that I looked at was <a href=\"https://github.com/creationix/wheat\">Wheat</a>.<br>Wheat is a light weight blogging engine, written by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/creationix\">Tim Caswell</a>, \na large contributor to the node community.  Wheat works by generating a blog site from\na set of markdown documents.  This is great for coders that use git on a daily basis.\nHowever, this is not the kind of setup you want if you are building a blog for\nnon-coders unless you feel like teaching someone how to use source control.<br>Feature-wise RSS and tagging are all there.  The templates are in HAML.<br>The great thing about Wheat is that it is almost no overhead.  It was designed \nspecific to its purpose.  The downside I saw is that its purpose might be too \nspecific for the kind of site that I wanted to build.  Also, the project on \ngithub had not been updated in over a year.</p>\n<h3 id=\"express\">Express</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://expressjs.com/\">Express</a> is web application framework that is built on the popular \n<a href=\"http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/\">Connect</a> middleware.\nI had a lot of familiarity with Express which meant I could start right away\nwithout learning the nuances of a new system.  Express also gives you a lot of tools\nand a very flexible system for using them.  The downside I saw with Express was\nthat there is a lot of overhead code.  When you evaulate a robust framework like\nExpress the question is to what extent your project will gain from all the tools \nthat it offers.  </p>\n<h3 id=\"poet\">Poet</h3>\n<p>I stumbled upon <a href=\"http://jsantell.github.io/poet/\">Poet</a> just doing research on \ndifferent blogging engines for node.  It was written by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jsantell\">Jordan Santell</a>. \nPoet, at first, looked a lot like Wheat, using markdown documents to create pages.\nThe main difference between Poet and Wheat is that Wheat can run on its own.  Poet, it\nturns out, is a nice little addon to Express, though you could easily write your\nown server like Wheat does.  The good thing with Poet is that it gave me some flexibility.\nIt had default behavior, but it also made all its helper code available via middleware \nmaking the default behavior optional.</p>\n<p>Finally, it was decision time.  Using Express alone I was going to have to store blog\nposts in a datastore like MongoDB.  That made hosting a little more difficult and I \nwould have to write more code and have more security risk.  With Wheat I didn&#39;t need\na datastore which made hosting easy, but I was worried that it was dated and that it \nwould restrict me.  Poet, in the end, was the perfect fit.  It eliminated the need \nfor datastorage, was being actively maintained, and gave me flexibility.  </p>\n",

I&#39;ll try to link to those when I get time.</p></p>\n<pre>// Load node to edit\n$node = node_load($your_node_id);\n\n// Index value of the cck field\n$index = 0;\n\n// value that you want to insert\n$new_value = 3;\n\n// Set value\n$node-&#62;field_your_field[$index] = array('value' =&#62; $new_value);\n\n// Save Node\nnode_save($node);\n\n// Update content if node exists, otherwise use content_insert()\ncontent_update($node);\n\n// Clear CCK data cache so the new value will be loaded for dispaly purposes\ndb_query(\"DELETE FROM {cache_content} WHERE cid = '%s'\", 'content:' . $node-&#62;nid . ':' . $node-&#62;vid);\n</pre><p><strong>Update:</strong></p>\n<p>Since writing this new things have come to light.  While the code above works.  It is overkill simply saving a CCK field.  Also, there are more than one scenario for updating.</p>\n<p>Scenario 1:  node_save</p>\n<pre>// Load node to edit\n$node = node_load($your_node_id);\n\n// Index value of the cck field (Depends on the number of values your field accepts)\n$index = 0;\n\n// Set value\n$node-&#62;field_your_field[$index] = array('value' =&#62; $new_value);\n\n// Save Node\nnode_save($node);\n</pre><p>node_save runs cache_clear_all() so you don't need to delete a row from CCK cache.</p>\n<p>Scenario 2: db_query</p>\n<pre>// Load node to edit\n$node = node_load($your_node_id);\n\n// Index value of the cck field (Depends on the number of values your field accepts)\n$index = 0;\n\n// Save Node\ndb_query('UPDATE {content_type_x} SET field_y=\"%s\" WHERE vid=\"%s\" AND nid=\"%s\"', $new_value, $node-&#62;vid, $node-&#62;nid);\n\n// Clear CCK data cache so the new value will be loaded for dispaly purposes\ndb_query(\"DELETE FROM {cache_content} WHERE cid = '%s'\", 'content:' . $node-&#62;nid .

Setup Database &bull; Create Database/ Grant Permission    \n  &bull; mysql -u root -p       \n  &bull; create database ___;       &#38;\n  &bull; grant all privileges on ___.* to boz@localhost ;     \n\n2.

If you add a custom error log, \n           make sure the directory and file exist in the file system.    \n           DocumentRoot /var/www/drupal   ServerName local.______.com\n  &bull; Link file to /etc/apache2/site-enabled or 'sudo a2ensite' sitename\n  * sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload\n</pre><p>Now lets look at the script.  The Ubuntu Community page for Drupal contains an <a href=\"https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Drupal#Install%20Script\" target=\"_blank\">installer shell script</a> that I used for as a starting point for writing this one.  Let's walk through it piece by piece.</p>\n<h3>Configuration</h3>\n<p>The installer script is set up to accept a bunch parameters.  I didn't want to have to type the same things over and over so I hard coded some of my system information as variables at the top. * Note: Lines starting with # are comments.</p>\n<pre> # User configuration \nuser=username\npassword=system_password \ndbpass=mysql_password \n# End User configuration \n</pre><h3>Setting up Drupal files</h3>\n<p>I use a <a href=\"http://drupal.org/node/43816\">multi-site configuration</a> in Drupal so that I don't have to have mutiple copies of Drupal core files and so that I don't have to manage more that one Drupal install.  This part of the scripts sets up the files and their permissions required by Drupal.  The variables $1 is the first argument passed to the script dynamically and refers to the site domain name.</p>\n<pre>echo \"Setting up local.$1\"\n\necho \"Setup required files/directories\"\nmkdir /home/$user/public_html/drupal/sites/$1\nmkdir /home/$user/public_html/drupal/sites/$1/modules\nmkdir /home/$user/public_html/drupal/sites/$1/themes\nmkdir /home/$user/public_html/drupal/sites/$1/files\n\necho \"Set permissions\"\nchmod -R 777 /home/$user/public_html/drupal/sites/$1/files\n</pre><h3>Setup MySQL Database</h3>\n<p>This section of the script sets up a database named $2 is a reference to the second argument passed to the script.</p>\n<pre>echo \"Create database reload mysql privileges\"\nmysql -uroot -p$dbpass -e \"DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS $2;\"\nmysql -uroot -p$dbpass -e \"CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS $2;\"\nmysql -uroot -p$dbpass -e \"GRANT USAGE ON $2.* TO '$user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '$password';\"\nmysql -uroot -p$dbpass -e \"GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON $2.* TO '$user'@'localhost';\"\nmysql -uroot -p$dbpass -e \"flush privileges;\"\n</pre><h3>Drupal Site Settings file</h3>\n<p>Adding a new site to Drupal requires a clean settings.php file, which Drupal will detect and redirect you to the install.php page once everything is set up.  I give full permission to this file so that Drupal can write to it later.</p>\n<pre>echo \"Config Drupal settings.php\"\ntouch /home/$user/public_html/drupal/sites/$1/settings.php\nchmod 777 /home/$user/public_html/drupal/sites/$1/settings.php\n</pre><h3>Enabling the Domain to Apache</h3>\n<p>This section tells Apache where to point to when the new domain is hit from the browser.

Managing Development Files for Apache</strong></p>\n<p>Apache is looking for my files in the /var/www directory.&#160; I want to keep my development files in my user directory.&#160; To solve this I create a link to my development folders and store them in /var/www.&#160; For example, if I wanted to run drupal local, which I do.&#160; I create a link to drupal in /var/www like so:</p>\n<p><code>ln -s /home/boz/public_html/drupal /var/www/drupal</code></p>\n<p><a title=\"ln\" href=\"http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi?ln\" target=\"_blank\">ln</a> is the command, \"-s\" means symbolic link, as opposed to a hard link, followed by the source directory and the new link.&#160; Now I can access my drupal site in apache while maintaining my development files from my user directory.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Managing Multisite Configuration in Drupal</strong></p>\n<p>Drupal allows you to run as many domains as you like while sharing the same core Drupal files.&#160; Included in my development cycle is the creation of a test site for my clients to look over my work and make sure everything good to go before we publish the site.&#160; If I haven't transfered the domain for their site to my host then I usually just use a subdomain of this site for the testing i.e. somesite.balancedscale.com.&#160; Drupal's multisite configuration is based on directories named after the domains they correspond to.&#160; I don't want to maintain two different Drupal directories for the same project and so I create a symbolic link on my host servers between the test site domain directory and the target domain directory.&#160; Here's is an example that I used on my most recent project for the website loftusheatingandac.com.</p>\n<p><code>ln -s /drupal/sites/loftusheatingandac.com /drupal/sites/loftuslennox.balancedscale.com</code></p>\n<p>Now when the domain is transfered I can just point it to the drupal folder and all is good.&#160; The test site and the production site use the same files and the same database.</p>\n<p>How do use Symbolic Links?</p>",
