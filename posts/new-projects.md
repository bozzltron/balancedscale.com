Things have been picking up here.  We just launched <a href="http://www.handymarv.com" title="www.handymarv.com">www.handymarv.com</a>!  This a site for Marv's Handyman Service out of Woodbine, Iowa.  Thanks goes out to <a href="http://www.labresh.com">LaBresh Media</a> for the contract design work.  The latest project is for a company named Kingdom Builders.  We are looking to have a homepage up for them this week.  I'll be adding a portfolio section to the site soon to showcase our work.  

Cheers.
