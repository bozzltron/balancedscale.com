There something new and exciting happening in the world of work these days.  Something of a paradigm shift.  
The workplace we once loathed, the timecards we punched and the clocks we once watched, for some, may be 
a thing of the past.  There is a new way to work.  An innovative, creative, fast-paced, FUN way to work.

The digital revolution is here and it is sucking up every tech worker it can find.  There is a great
demand for high quality skilled workers and we are not just talking computer programmers here.  We are talking
about managers, salesman, customer support, human resources, executives, engineers, and the list goes on.  There is 
such demand that companies have had to evolve to get the talent they are looking for.  Its not longer enough
to be paid fairly or have great benefits.  Work has to be a place that you want to be.  A place that 
you enjoy and even have fun.  A place with a sense of purpose.  And while these changes seem to manifest in 
technology companies, there emerges a lesson for every company.  

Culture matters.
