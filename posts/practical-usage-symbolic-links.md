<p>Symbolic links work kind of like shortcuts in Windows.&#160; I have found a couple of very useful scenarios.&#160; The first is my local development environment.&#160; For Linux users, it is best practice to keep all your files in your user folder.&#160; For me, this is mainly to keep my system directories clean and to make backup of my files easier.&#160; This leads me to my first usage:</p>
<p><strong>1. Managing Development Files for Apache</strong></p>
<p>Apache is looking for my files in the /var/www directory.&#160; I want to keep my development files in my user directory.&#160; To solve this I create a link to my development folders and store them in /var/www.&#160; For example, if I wanted to run drupal local, which I do.&#160; I create a link to drupal in /var/www like so:</p>
<p><code>ln -s /home/boz/public_html/drupal /var/www/drupal</code></p>
<p><a title="ln" href="http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi?ln" target="_blank">ln</a> is the command, "-s" means symbolic link, as opposed to a hard link, followed by the source directory and the new link.&#160; Now I can access my drupal site in apache while maintaining my development files from my user directory.</p>
<p><strong>2. Managing Multisite Configuration in Drupal</strong></p>
<p>Drupal allows you to run as many domains as you like while sharing the same core Drupal files.&#160; Included in my development cycle is the creation of a test site for my clients to look over my work and make sure everything good to go before we publish the site.&#160; If I haven't transfered the domain for their site to my host then I usually just use a subdomain of this site for the testing i.e. somesite.balancedscale.com.&#160; Drupal's multisite configuration is based on directories named after the domains they correspond to.&#160; I don't want to maintain two different Drupal directories for the same project and so I create a symbolic link on my host servers between the test site domain directory and the target domain directory.&#160; Here's is an example that I used on my most recent project for the website loftusheatingandac.com.</p>
<p><code>ln -s /drupal/sites/loftusheatingandac.com /drupal/sites/loftuslennox.balancedscale.com</code></p>
<p>Now when the domain is transfered I can just point it to the drupal folder and all is good.&#160; The test site and the production site use the same files and the same database.</p>
<p>How do use Symbolic Links?</p>
