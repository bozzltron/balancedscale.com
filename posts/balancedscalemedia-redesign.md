Balancedscale.com got some love with a complete rewrite.  We moved from a Drupal 6 platform
to the node.js Express framework.  Why?  Sometimes you have to create opporutunities 
to learn new skils and put them into practice.  We are passionate about node.js.
Also, we wanted to simpify the site in terms of structure and implement
a responsive design for accessibility of the content on most devices.

With that, we are going to post the migration process in a multi-part blog posting so 
that others can learn from out mistakes.

Stay tuned...
