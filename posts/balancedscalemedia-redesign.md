Balancedscale.com got some love with a complete rewrite.  The site moved from a Drupal 6 platform
to the node.js Express framework.  Why?  Sometimes you have to create opporutunities 
to learn new skils and put them into practice.  I am passionate about node.js.
Also, I wanted to simpify the site in terms of structure and implement
a responsive design for accessibility of the content on most devices.

With that, I am going to post the migration process in a multi-part blog posting so 
that others can learn from the knowledge gained.

Stay tuned...
