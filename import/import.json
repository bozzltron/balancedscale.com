You can accomplish the same thing as auto node title with two Drupal hooks which you can include in the .module file of your feature.  Problem solved.

That often, the complex tasks are simple and yet the trivial tasks are difficult.</p><p>The typical scenario for a Drupal build starts with a requirements document.  The Drupal developer lists out the functionality that he or she needs and starts to come up with a list contributed modules that may be useful for accomplishing said functionality.  To his or her surprise several of these modules \"just work\" and reports amazing progress.  There is probably one module, however, that doesn't do exactly what is needed and is substituted for an alternative.  Maybe it is even a rewrite, but this no sweat to the Drupal developer.  But then it happens!  A mundane task suddenly becomes a blocker and several Google queries / IM discussions / reading chapters of Pro Drupal Development later there is an aha moment followed by the question \"Why is this simple task so hard to do in Drupal?\".</p><p>Let's be careful now.  Its not all Drupal's fault.  After all the contributed module pool is vast and the issues I have encountered more often then not, have to do with a contributed module.  But drawing a line between core and contributed modules is merely a technicality.  A quality development framework should make difficult tasks easy and trivial tasks negligible.

1. Apple and Microsoft support Theora making  it the universal video format.  Because this involves two corporations, this will be delayed a number of years.  Apple opposes Theora because it doesn't have hardware decoding support which saves battery life on their iphone, ipod, ipad devices.  Microsoft is implementing a ton of stuff for IE9, but has not announced that they will implementing the Theora codec.  Plus they probably have hang ups similar to Apple.

2. Apple supports WebM or VP8.  IE9 is going to implement WebM which makes Apple the odd man out for supporting WebM.  If the Apple adopts it, than WebM will be the universal video format for the web.  This is far more likely than the first scenario because VP8 has hardware decoding and similar if not better quality to h.264.

3. H.264 is open sourced and becomes universal.  This is very unlikely because the group that owns it is not tied to a company that is developing browsers and they are making a lot of money.

4. Deadlock.  Apple and Microsoft ignore Theora and Apple refuses to implement WebM for whatever reason.

What do you think?",

<p>3. For Bazaar support,&#160; I installed the <a href=\"http://bazaar-vcs.org/BzrEclipse\" target=\"_blank\">Bazaar plugin</a> for Eclipse.</p>

  &bull; Link file to /etc/apache2/site-enabled or 'sudo a2ensite' sitename
  * sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload
</pre>
<p>Now lets look at the script.  The Ubuntu Community page for Drupal contains an <a href=\"https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Drupal#Install%20Script\" target=\"_blank\">installer shell script</a> that I used for as a starting point for writing this one.  Let's walk through it piece by piece.</p>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>The installer script is set up to accept a bunch parameters.  I didn't want to have to type the same things over and over so I hard coded some of my system information as variables at the top. * Note: Lines starting with # are comments.</p>
<pre> # User configuration 
user=username
password=system_password 
dbpass=mysql_password 
# End User configuration 
</pre>
<h3>Setting up Drupal files</h3>
<p>I use a <a href=\"http://drupal.org/node/43816\">multi-site configuration</a> in Drupal so that I don't have to have mutiple copies of Drupal core files and so that I don't have to manage more that one Drupal install.  This part of the scripts sets up the files and their permissions required by Drupal.  The variables $1 is the first argument passed to the script dynamically and refers to the site domain name.</p>
<pre>echo \"Setting up local.$1\"

echo \"Setup required files/directories\"
mkdir /home/$user/public_html/drupal/sites/$1
mkdir /home/$user/public_html/drupal/sites/$1/modules
mkdir /home/$user/public_html/drupal/sites/$1/themes
mkdir /home/$user/public_html/drupal/sites/$1/files

echo \"Set permissions\"
chmod -R 777 /home/$user/public_html/drupal/sites/$1/files
</pre>
<h3>Setup MySQL Database</h3>
<p>This section of the script sets up a database named $2 is a reference to the second argument passed to the script.</p>
<pre>echo \"Create database reload mysql privileges\"
mysql -uroot -p$dbpass -e \"DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS $2;\"
mysql -uroot -p$dbpass -e \"CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS $2;\"
mysql -uroot -p$dbpass -e \"GRANT USAGE ON $2.* TO '$user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '$password';\"
mysql -uroot -p$dbpass -e \"GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON $2.* TO '$user'@'localhost';\"
mysql -uroot -p$dbpass -e \"flush privileges;\"
</pre>
<h3>Drupal Site Settings file</h3>
<p>Adding a new site to Drupal requires a clean settings.php file, which Drupal will detect and redirect you to the install.php page once everything is set up.  I give full permission to this file so that Drupal can write to it later.</p>
<pre>echo \"Config Drupal settings.php\"
touch /home/$user/public_html/drupal/sites/$1/settings.php
chmod 777 /home/$user/public_html/drupal/sites/$1/settings.php
</pre>
<h3>Enabling the Domain to Apache</h3>
<p>This section tells Apache where to point to when the new domain is hit from the browser.  I'm just pointing it to my drupal folder.  Notice that I use \"local.\" in front of my domain.  This is just my preference when I set up a development site.  You can use whatever domain you like.  The \"a2ensite\" command enables the site in Apache.</p>
<pre>echo \"Set up Apache config file\" 
echo \"\" &#62;/etc/apache2/sites-available/local.$1
echo \"  DocumentRoot /var/www/drupal\" &#62;&#62;/etc/apache2/sites-available/local.$1
echo \"  ServerName $1\" &#62;&#62;/etc/apache2/sites-available/local.$1
echo \"\" &#62;&#62;/etc/apache2/sites-available/local.$1

echo \"Enable Apache site\"
a2ensite local.$1
</pre>
<h3>Add Domain to your Host file</h3>
<p>All that's left to do now is to write the new domain to your host file and restart Apache.</p>
<pre>echo \"Add domain to host file\"
echo \"127.0.0.1 local.$1\" &#62;&#62;/etc/hosts

echo \"Restart apache\"
/etc/init.d/apache2 force-reload

echo \"Done\"
</pre>
<p>Once the script has finished executing I can pull up my browser, enter in the new domain, which pulls up the Drupal install page.  Enjoy!</p>
<p>Here's the full script!</p>
<pre># User configuration
user=
password=
dbpass=
# End User configuration

echo \"Setting up local.$1\"

<p><strong>1. Managing Development Files for Apache</strong></p>
<p>Apache is looking for my files in the /var/www directory.&#160; I want to keep my development files in my user directory.&#160; To solve this I create a link to my development folders and store them in /var/www.&#160; For example, if I wanted to run drupal local, which I do.&#160; I create a link to drupal in /var/www like so:</p>
<p><code>ln -s /home/boz/public_html/drupal /var/www/drupal</code></p>
<p><a title=\"ln\" href=\"http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi?ln\" target=\"_blank\">ln</a> is the command, \"-s\" means symbolic link, as opposed to a hard link, followed by the source directory and the new link.&#160; Now I can access my drupal site in apache while maintaining my development files from my user directory.</p>
<p><strong>2. Managing Multisite Configuration in Drupal</strong></p>
<p>Drupal allows you to run as many domains as you like while sharing the same core Drupal files.&#160; Included in my development cycle is the creation of a test site for my clients to look over my work and make sure everything good to go before we publish the site.&#160; If I haven't transfered the domain for their site to my host then I usually just use a subdomain of this site for the testing i.e. somesite.balancedscale.com.&#160; Drupal's multisite configuration is based on directories named after the domains they correspond to.&#160; I don't want to maintain two different Drupal directories for the same project and so I create a symbolic link on my host servers between the test site domain directory and the target domain directory.&#160; Here's is an example that I used on my most recent project for the website loftusheatingandac.com.</p>
<p><code>ln -s /drupal/sites/loftusheatingandac.com /drupal/sites/loftuslennox.balancedscale.com</code></p>
<p>Now when the domain is transfered I can just point it to the drupal folder and all is good.&#160; The test site and the production site use the same files and the same database.</p>
<p>How do use Symbolic Links?</p>",

Europa is not the latest version of Eclipse, which I also use, so after extracting Europa to my /home/<username> folder I renamed it to \"europa\".  
</li>
<li><a href=\"http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flex/flexbuilder_linux/\"><strong>Download Flex Builder Linux Alpha</a> from Adobe Labs</strong></li>
<li><strong>Run The Flex Builder Install Script</strong>
Follow the instructions from the Adobe Labs on running the install script.  Note that before running these commands you need to open up a terminal and navigate to the folder where your \".bin\" file is located.
<blockquote>
Run the installer either marking it as executable (chmod +x) or by using a shell to execute it (sh flexbuilder_linux_install_a4_081408.bin).

When prompted, specify whether to install Flash Player 9 (note that this is an updated version of Flash Player 9 and that Flex Builder Linux will work with earlier versions of Flash Player 9 for Linux). This is the debug version of Flash Player 9, which is required for debugging support and exception display.
</blockquote>
The install script will ask you where eclipse is located which is when you want to point it to your eclipse folder, in my case named \"europa\".
<li><strong>Run Eclipse</strong>
Now when you run Eclipse, it will ask you what workspace you want to use.  Make sure that you create and new Flex workspace and are not using a workspace used by another Eclipse install. 
</li>
<li><strong>Start A Flex Project</strong>
Once Eclipse has opened you should be able to create a Flex project by clicking \"File->New->Other...\".  In the window click the Flex Builder folder icon which has several options including \"Flex Project\", which is generally what you will use for a Flex application.
