Setup Database &bull; Create Database\/ Grant Permission    \r\n  &bull; mysql -u root -p       \r\n  &bull; create database ___;       &amp;\r\n  &bull; grant all privileges on ___.* to boz@localhost ;     \r\n\r\n2. Add server name to host file \/etc\/hosts    \r\n\r\n3. Enable site in Apache      \r\n  &bull; Create file in \/etc\/apache2\/sites-available \r\n  &bull; Add DocumentRoot and ServerName info.  If you add a custom error log, \r\n           make sure the directory and file exist in the file system.    \r\n           DocumentRoot \/var\/www\/drupal   ServerName local.______.com\r\n  &bull; Link file to \/etc\/apache2\/site-enabled or 'sudo a2ensite' sitename\r\n  * sudo \/etc\/init.d\/apache2 reload\r\n\r\nNow lets look at the script.  The Ubuntu Community page for Drupal contains an installer shell script that I used for as a starting point for writing this one.  Let's walk through it piece by piece.\r\nConfiguration\r\nThe installer script is set up to accept a bunch parameters.  I didn't want to have to type the same things over and over so I hard coded some of my system information as variables at the top. * Note: Lines starting with # are comments.\r\n # User configuration \r\nuser=username\r\npassword=system_password \r\ndbpass=mysql_password \r\n# End User configuration \r\n\r\nSetting up Drupal files\r\nI use a multi-site configuration in Drupal so that I don't have to have mutiple copies of Drupal core files and so that I don't have to manage more that one Drupal install.  This part of the scripts sets up the files and their permissions required by Drupal.  The variables $1 is the first argument passed to the script dynamically and refers to the site domain name.\r\necho \"Setting up local.$1\"\r\n\r\necho \"Setup required files\/directories\"\r\nmkdir \/home\/$user\/public_html\/drupal\/sites\/$1\r\nmkdir \/home\/$user\/public_html\/drupal\/sites\/$1\/modules\r\nmkdir \/home\/$user\/public_html\/drupal\/sites\/$1\/themes\r\nmkdir \/home\/$user\/public_html\/drupal\/sites\/$1\/files\r\n\r\necho \"Set permissions\"\r\nchmod -R 777 \/home\/$user\/public_html\/drupal\/sites\/$1\/files\r\n\r\nSetup MySQL Database\r\nThis section of the script sets up a database named $2 is a reference to the second argument passed to the script.\r\necho \"Create database reload mysql privileges\"\r\nmysql -uroot -p$dbpass -e \"DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS $2;\"\r\nmysql -uroot -p$dbpass -e \"CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS $2;\"\r\nmysql -uroot -p$dbpass -e \"GRANT USAGE ON $2.* TO '$user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '$password';\"\r\nmysql -uroot -p$dbpass -e \"GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON $2.* TO '$user'@'localhost';\"\r\nmysql -uroot -p$dbpass -e \"flush privileges;\"\r\n\r\nDrupal Site Settings file\r\nAdding a new site to Drupal requires a clean settings.php file, which Drupal will detect and redirect you to the install.php page once everything is set up.  I give full permission to this file so that Drupal can write to it later.\r\necho \"Config Drupal settings.php\"\r\ntouch \/home\/$user\/public_html\/drupal\/sites\/$1\/settings.php\r\nchmod 777 \/home\/$user\/public_html\/drupal\/sites\/$1\/settings.php\r\n\r\nEnabling the Domain to Apache\r\nThis section tells Apache where to point to when the new domain is hit from the browser.  I'm just pointing it to my drupal folder.  Notice that I use \"local.\" in front of my domain.  This is just my preference when I set up a development site.  You can use whatever domain you like.  The \"a2ensite\" command enables the site in Apache.\r\necho \"Set up Apache config file\" \r\necho \"\" &gt;\/etc\/apache2\/sites-available\/local.$1\r\necho \"  DocumentRoot \/var\/www\/drupal\" &gt;&gt;\/etc\/apache2\/sites-available\/local.$1\r\necho \"  ServerName $1\" &gt;&gt;\/etc\/apache2\/sites-available\/local.$1\r\necho \"\" &gt;&gt;\/etc\/apache2\/sites-available\/local.$1\r\n\r\necho \"Enable Apache site\"\r\na2ensite local.$1\r\n\r\nAdd Domain to your Host file\r\nAll that's left to do now is to write the new domain to your host file and restart Apache.\r\necho \"Add domain to host file\"\r\necho \"127.0.0.1 local.$1\" &gt;&gt;\/etc\/hosts\r\n\r\necho \"Restart apache\"\r\n\/etc\/init.d\/apache2 force-reload\r\n\r\necho \"Done\"\r\n\r\nOnce the script has finished executing I can pull up my browser, enter in the new domain, which pulls up the Drupal install page.

(Click on the gear icon in each panel and select \"Add Content\")Click \"Update and Save\"Repeat steps 3-11 for each page.Note that the order of the variants is important.&nbsp; You can think of the vertical list of variants for the panel as a switch statement.&nbsp; This means Drupal will check if the first variants selection rules match and move on to the next if they do not.&nbsp; However, if they do match then it ignores the rest of the variants.&nbsp; This was confusing to me until I figured out how it worked.&nbsp; This could be leveraged if you want to used a default variant whose selectoin rules are more broadly satisfied.","path":"","created":"1268189251","teaser":"For one of my recent projects, I had the privelege of learning how to use the Drupal panels module.&nbsp; I needed a panel that swapped out content based on which page I was on.&nbsp; Here is how to do it:","title":"Nid Based Panel Variants in Drupal","changed":"1268189372","timestamp":"1268189372","name":"Drupal"}},{"node":{"body":"This is not a comprehensive comparison, but is a comparison of the functions that I used the most.

That often, the complex tasks are simple and yet the trivial tasks are difficult.The typical scenario for a Drupal build starts with a requirements document.  The Drupal developer lists out the functionality that he or she needs and starts to come up with a list contributed modules that may be useful for accomplishing said functionality.  To his or her surprise several of these modules \"just work\" and reports amazing progress.  There is probably one module, however, that doesn't do exactly what is needed and is substituted for an alternative.  Maybe it is even a rewrite, but this no sweat to the Drupal developer.  But then it happens!  A mundane task suddenly becomes a blocker and several Google queries \/ IM discussions \/ reading chapters of Pro Drupal Development later there is an aha moment followed by the question \"Why is this simple task so hard to do in Drupal?\".Let's be careful now.  Its not all Drupal's fault.  After all the contributed module pool is vast and the issues I have encountered more often then not, have to do with a contributed module.
