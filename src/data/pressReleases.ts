**mozworth Bridges Worlds with New Summer Single "Sandpiper"**

*A guitar-driven, ocean-soaked anthem inspired by myth, nature, and the quiet messengers all around us*

**AUSTIN, TX – August 21, 2025** — South Austin songwriter mozworth releases Sandpiper, a sweeping new single shaped by the rhythms of the Gulf Coast, the weight of mythology, and the search for answers in uncertain times. It follows this spring's The Sky Is Falling and acts as its emotional companion — where one named the fracture, the other seeks the bridge.

The song took shape during a family trip to Surfside Beach, Texas — days filled with skimboarding, saltwater, and long walks along the shore. It was there that the sandpiper first caught mozworth's attention. "When you're walking along the coastline, you have the ocean to one side and land to the other. Ahead of you is that narrow strip of wet sand. That's where you find the sandpiper," he says.

Drawn deeper, he found the sandpiper in Native American, Celtic, and Japanese myths — as a navigator, a survivor, a lost soul, and a messenger between worlds. "The idea of the messenger grabbed me the most", says mozworth. "I started to see the sandpiper as inspiration. If this bird can merge two wildly different words, perhaps so can we. I love the idea that the answer is hidden in plain sight in the form of this humble creature."

The recording process was loose and instinctual. "I had a lot of lyrical ideas, but no sound yet," he says. Starting with a one-mic drum improv and a bassline, he followed what felt good. Listening back, what is now the driving bassline of the song was found. A guitar melody soon took shape using his daughter's Harley Benton JA-60, now a fixture of the song's identity. "That guitar — it just sang. The leads started sounding like birds to me."

The band brought the track to life. Longtime collaborator Ken Mockler locked in the drum parts before relocating to Denver, making this one of his last recordings with the group. "Ken loved the chorus — we really wrestled with the verses to make sure that left room for the chorus to break through" says mozworth. Guitarist Mark Heaps added shimmering textures and dynamic contrast, while bassist Jack Schultz nailed a tone the whole group instantly fell in love with.

The final mix, crafted by Steve Glaze at Tone Freq Studios, opens with the nostalgic click of a guitar cable — a subtle link to the lo-fi textures of '90s alt-rock. If you play The Sky Is Falling first, it fades out like a radio switching off. Sandpiper clicks right back on — not planned, but somehow perfect.

The single was recorded at mozworth's home studio in South Austin, drums at Ken's place just across town. "We wanted to capture who we are right now — together, in this moment," he says.

With Ken's move, drummer Mike Hall steps in for the Sandpiper single release. Introduced by Ken and already a kindred spirit, Mike brings a new heartbeat to mozworth's evolving sound — raw, melodic, and rooted in the human experience.

**mozworth's New Single "The Sky Is Falling" Channels Chaos Into Connection**

**Austin, TX** — Just as 2025 shook the world with uncertainty, Austin-based indie outfit mozworth found their footing in the turbulence—and turned it into something unforgettable. Their new release "The Sky Is Falling" is a powerful single that captures the weight of living through history in real time. Equal parts raw and reflective, the song is both a document of our times and a deeply personal snapshot of a band coming into its own.

Frontman and songwriter mozworth began writing "The Sky Is Falling" in the earliest days of 2025, a period marked by global unrest. What emerged from that fog was a sound that captures the tension of the moment—a song that feels like you are no longer in control but along for the ride. The project's title, borrowed from the fable of Chicken Little, is a poetic nod to the panic, misinformation, and distorted realities that defined this cultural moment.

But "The Sky Is Falling" isn't just a personal reckoning—it's a band coming into full bloom. It marks the first recording with the full mozworth lineup: Mark Heaps (electric guitar), Jack Schultz (bass), and Ken Mockler (drums).

With this lineup, mozworth began touring the Austin area including SXSW and something unexpected happened. The respect for the music was the start, the musicianship brought to the live show was the evolution, but the community that took shape was a surprise. "We're not just guys showing up to do the task of performing music, we are people that genuinely care about each other," says mozworth. "From the earliest rehearsals, there has always been a good energy about us being in the same room. We've confided in and supported each other along the way. It's out of the richness of the relationships and musicianship that mozworth now brings new music forth."

Each member not only contributed their own parts to "The Sky Is Falling," they operated in the mode of a composer suggesting new parts and driving the song to its full potential. "The Sky Is Falling" was tracked entirely in South Austin—recorded across home studios, including mozworth's and Mockler's home studios. Mixing duties were handled by Steven Glaze at Tone Freq Studios, whose touch brought warmth and clarity to the song's layered, dynamic sound.

At its heart, "The Sky Is Falling" is more than a commentary on the state of the world—it's a love letter to collaboration, to growth, and to the strange beauty of staying human when the world feels like it's on fire. It's about finding your people in the noise and trying to produce a melody.
